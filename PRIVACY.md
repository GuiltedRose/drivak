Drivak Privacy Policy

Last updated: [TO BE FILLED AT LAUNCH]

Drivak is a 100% offline, open-source application designed to assist tabletop roleplaying game masters and players. We believe that privacy is a fundamental right, and we have designed Drivak with transparency and user control at its core.

üîí Core Principles

No Internet RequirementDrivak does not require an internet connection to run. All features are available offline, by default and by design.

No Data CollectionWe do not collect or transmit any personal data, usage statistics, or telemetry. There are no analytics libraries, no hidden logging, and no background data collection.

Open Source TransparencyThe entire codebase is available publicly and can be audited by anyone. You can verify exactly how data is handled by reading the source or building the application yourself.

No Third-Party ServicesDrivak does not rely on third-party APIs, servers, or cloud platforms. All processing and data storage is performed locally on your device.

Full Data OwnershipAll characters, maps, notes, mods, and campaign data you create with Drivak are stored locally. You have complete control over your files and can back them up, copy them, or delete them at any time.

üì± Mobile App Permissions (Android Version)

Drivak Mobile is developed with the same privacy-first mindset. It will request the minimum permissions necessary for core functionality:

Storage Access: To save and load character data, maps, notes, and PDFs. Scoped storage will be used wherever possible.

Media Access (Optional): To allow users to attach images to characters or campaign elements, only when the user initiates the action.

USB Access (Optional): If the app detects a connected desktop Drivak instance, it may prompt to copy relevant files ‚Äî only with user approval.

No Internet Permission: The mobile app does not request internet access. There is no background sync or network communication.

ü§ù Your Trust Matters

We know that as a DM or player, your worlds, notes, and characters are deeply personal. We‚Äôve built Drivak to respect your privacy and preserve your autonomy.

If you ever discover a part of Drivak that behaves in a way inconsistent with this policy, please report it. We take all such issues seriously.

This policy applies to all versions of Drivak on desktop and mobile platforms.
